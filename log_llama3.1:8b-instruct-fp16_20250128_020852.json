(handling user interactions, displaying information), business logic (managing user profiles, courses, news, certifications), and data persistence (storing user data, content, etc.). A layered architecture naturally separates these concerns, improving maintainability, testability, and the potential for independent scaling of layers in the future.\nEvent-Driven Architecture (Pub-Sub Architecture): While there are some events (e.g., job posting approval, ad expiration reminders), they don't appear to be the primary drivers of the system's functionality. A full-fledged pub-sub architecture might be overkill. However, using events for specific actions like notifications could be beneficial.\nMicrokernel Architecture: This pattern is not a good fit. The core functionality is relatively well-defined (content management, user management, course/event listings). There isn't a strong need for a plug-in architecture to extend core features, although some minor elements like payment gateways or notification services could potentially be implemented as plugins in the future.\nMicroservices Architecture: This project has distinct functional areas that could be implemented as microservices: user management (including authentication and authorization), content management (news, articles, FAQs), certification management (applications, approvals, trainer ratings), course/event management, and job board management. Each microservice could be independently developed, deployed, and scaled. The application seems big enough that this architecture would be beneficial.\nSpace-Based Architecture: This pattern is not relevant to the project as described. The application doesn't deal with massive datasets or highly concurrent operations that require distributed shared memory.\nPipeline Architecture (Pipe-Filter Architecture): There are a few potential applications for a pipeline pattern, such as processing new job postings (approval, notification) or handling certification applications. However, these are not central to the overall system architecture. There may also be a use case in the processing of news and articles to transform them into RSS feeds.\nClient-Server Architecture: This is fundamental to the project. The application is web-based, with users interacting through web browsers (clients) and a server handling requests, data, and business logic.\n\nFinal Scores:\n\n**Layered Architecture**: 4\n**Event-Driven Architecture (Pub-Sub Architecture)**: 2\n**Microkernel Architecture**: 1\n**Microservices Architecture**: 4\n**Space-Based Architecture**: 1\n**Pipeline Architecture (Pipe-Filter Architecture)**: 2\n**Client-Server Architecture**: 5\n\n- EXAMPLE RUN END -\n\n",
