      "\n",
      "4. **Maintainability**: The modular nature of Pipeline Architecture makes it easier to maintain and update individual components without affecting the entire system, which aligns with user stories such as \"As a Data Publishing User, I want to be able to edit the model of data I have already imported...\" and \"As a Developer, I want to design the system using distributed, decoupled patterns...\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Accessibility**: The Pipeline Architecture can support multiple interfaces and APIs, making it accessible to different types of users, which is evident from user stories such as \"As a Data Consuming User, I want to be able to share an image of a particular view state to the social networks...\" and \"As an API User, I want to be able to change the colors of the embedded visualisations...\".\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Flexibility**: The Pipeline Architecture can accommodate changing requirements and new features, which is critical for user stories such as \"As a Developer, I want to integrate distributed in-memory data grids for caching and state management...\" and \"As a Platform Administrator, I want to deploy and monitor distributed processing nodes...\".\n",
