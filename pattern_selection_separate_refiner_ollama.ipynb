It is particularly well suited for applications requiring consistent performance, high stability, and minimal latency, even under unexpected traffic surges or spikes.\\nPipeline Architecture: Pipeline Architecture organizes the system into a series of processing stages (filters) connected by channels (pipes). Data flows through the pipeline, being transformed at each stage. It simplifies complex processing tasks by breaking them into smaller, independent steps.\\nClient-Server Architecture: Client-Server Architecture separates the application into client components that request services and server components that provide services.
