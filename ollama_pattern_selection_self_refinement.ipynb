    "\n",
    "Here are the architecture patterns you will score:\n",
    "*Layered Architecture \n",
    "*Event-Driven Architecture (Pub-Sub Architecture) \n",
    "*Microkernel Architecture \n",
    "*Microservices Architecture \n",
    "*Space-Based Architecture\n",
    "*Pipeline Architecture (Pipe-Filter Architecture) \n",
    "*Client-Server Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the descriptions for each pattern and usage examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Layered Architecture\n",
    "Layered Architecture organizes software into horizontal layers, each with distinct responsibilities such as presentation, business logic, and data persistence. The core idea is that each layer only interacts with the layer directly beneath it, which makes the system more manageable and easier to maintain. Changes within a single layer can often be made without affecting other layers, enhancing modifiability. It also facilitates the separation of concerns, allowing teams to focus on specific layers without impacting the entire system. However, it can introduce performance overhead if there are many layers and each request must pass through them.\n",
    "Typical Usage Example:\n",
    "A common example is an enterprise web application with a front-end/UI layer, a service or business logic layer, and a database access layer. For instance, many Java EE or .NET applications follow a Layered Architecture to clearly separate presentation, business, and data access concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Event-Driven Architecture (Pub-Sub Architecture)\n",
    "In an Event-Driven Architecture, components communicate primarily through the production and consumption of events. Publishers emit events without knowing which subscribers will be interested in them, and subscribers react when they receive relevant events. This decouples event producers from consumers, making the system more flexible and scalable. It also allows for asynchronous processing, where components can respond to events at different times. However, debugging can be more complex due to the non-linear flow of events and the indirect communication paths.\n",
    "Typical Usage Example:\n",
    "A common example is a messaging system with a message broker like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ. For instance, e-commerce platforms use an event-driven approach to process inventory updates, orders, and notifications asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Microkernel Architecture\n",
    "Microkernel Architecture (also known as Plugin Architecture) consists of a core system, or “kernel,” that provides the fundamental services, and additional features are implemented as plug-in modules around it. The core is kept minimal and stable, with most business logic or specialized features added through extensions or plugins. This allows for easy customization and extensibility, since new modules can be added without modifying the kernel. It also improves system resilience because a faulty plugin can be disabled or replaced without bringing down the entire system. However, designing a robust microkernel can be complex as it must accommodate a wide range of future extensions.\n",
    "Typical Usage Example:\n",
    "Examples include operating systems like the early versions of Mac OS X (with its Mach microkernel) and Eclipse IDE, where the core platform loads various plugin modules for functionality such as language support, testing tools, or version control integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Microservices Architecture\n",
    "Microservices Architecture breaks down an application into smaller, independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific business capability. Each service can be built, tested, deployed, and scaled independently, which promotes agility and faster development cycles. Teams can choose different technologies or databases for each service if needed, providing flexibility. However, this approach introduces complexity in inter-service communication, monitoring, and data consistency. DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, and robust service discovery mechanisms are usually critical for successful microservices deployments.\n",
    "Typical Usage Example:\n",
    "Netflix is a well-known practitioner of microservices, splitting its platform into small, specialized services for managing user data, recommendation algorithms, and video streaming, among others. Likewise, many modern e-commerce companies adopt microservices to handle catalog services, shopping cart, and payment services separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Space-Based Architecture\n",
    "Space-Based Architecture (also called Cloud-Based or Tuple Space Architecture) uses the concept of a “data grid” or “processing grid,” where the application components share a common distributed memory or “space.” It is designed to handle high scalability and peak loads by distributing both the data and the processing across multiple nodes. Components can write data or tasks into the space, and other components pick up the tasks or data for processing. This approach reduces bottlenecks by avoiding central databases at high transaction volumes. However, it can be more complex to implement and manage due to the distributed nature of both data and processing.\n",
    "Typical Usage Example:\n",
    "Retail websites dealing with heavy seasonal traffic (like Black Friday sales) might use space-based architecture to handle massive spikes in transactions. GigaSpaces is a known platform that implements this pattern to allow for in-memory data sharing and fast scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pipeline Architecture (Pipe-Filter Architecture)\n",
    "Pipeline Architecture, also known as Pipe-Filter, organizes processing steps into a sequence of filters, where the output of one filter is the input to the next. Each filter performs a distinct operation, and data flows continuously through the pipeline. This makes the system modular, as filters can be swapped or reordered without changing the surrounding components. It is particularly suitable for data processing or transformation workflows. However, it might not be optimal for interactive applications needing bidirectional communication.\n",
    "Typical Usage Example:\n",
    "A classic example is a data processing workflow in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, where you have steps for extracting raw data, cleaning and transforming it, and finally loading it into a target system or database.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Client-Server Architecture\n",
    "Client-Server Architecture divides the system into two main parts: clients that request services or resources, and a server that processes these requests and returns a response. This structure simplifies the way users interact with shared data or centralized processes. The server can be scaled up independently, and security or permissions can be centrally managed. However, if the server fails or becomes overloaded, clients will be unable to access the service. It remains a fundamental design pattern for many networked applications.\n",
    "Typical Usage Example:\n",
    "Any typical web application employs a client-server setup: a web browser (client) connects to a remote web server to fetch and display web pages. Another example is email clients communicating with a mail server over protocols like IMAP/POP3 for receiving mail and SMTP for sending mail.\n",
