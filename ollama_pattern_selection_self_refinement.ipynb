Replaceability\": [],\\n    \"Analyzability & Traceability\": []\\n  }\\n\\n\\n-OUTPUT-\\n\\nReasoning:\\n\\nLayered Architecture: The project involves distinct responsibilities: presentation (handling user interactions, displaying information), business logic (managing user profiles, courses, news, certifications), and data persistence (storing user data, content, etc.). A layered architecture naturally separates these concerns, improving maintainability, testability, and the potential for independent scaling of layers in the future.\\nEvent-Driven Architecture (Pub-Sub Architecture): While there are some events (e.g., job posting approval, ad expiration reminders), they don\\'t appear to be the primary drivers of the system\\'s functionality. A full-fledged pub-sub architecture might be overkill. However, using events for specific actions like notifications could be beneficial.\\nMicrokernel Architecture: This pattern is not a good fit. The core functionality is relatively well-defined (content management, user management, course/event listings). There isn\\'t a strong need for a plug-in architecture to extend core features, although some minor elements like payment gateways or notification services could potentially be implemented as plugins in the future.\\nMicroservices Architecture: This project has distinct functional areas that could be implemented as microservices: user management (including authentication and authorization), content management (news, articles, FAQs), certification management (applications, approvals, trainer ratings), course/event management, and job board management. The application seems big enough that this architecture would be beneficial.\\nSpace-Based Architecture: This pattern is not relevant to the project as described. The application doesn\\'t deal with massive datasets or highly concurrent operations that require distributed shared memory.\\nPipeline Architecture (Pipe-Filter Architecture): There are a few potential applications for a pipeline pattern, such as processing new job postings (approval, notification) or handling certification applications. However, these are not central to the overall system architecture. There may also be a use case in the processing of news and articles to transform them into RSS feeds.\\nClient-Server Architecture: This is fundamental to the project. The application is web-based, with users interacting through web browsers (clients) and a server handling requests, data, and business logic.\\n\\nFinal Scores in JSON format:\\n\\n{\\n  \"Layered Architecture\": 4,\\n  \"Event-Driven Architecture\": 2,\\n  \"Microkernel Architecture\": 1,\\n  \"Microservices Architecture\":4,\\n  \"Space-Based Architecture\": 1,\\n  \"Pipeline Architecture\": 2,\\n  \"Client-Server Architecture\": 5\\n}\\n        \\n        - EXAMPLE RUN END -\\n\\n        '"

This supports the use of an event-driven architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microkernel Architecture: The core functionality of the project is relatively well-defined (game management, estimator management, estimate processing), but some user stories suggest a need for even more extensibility. For example, a developer wants to have created database indexes to improve query performance or integrate with external services. This suggests that the microkernel architecture could be partially suitable or well suited for the project's requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microservices Architecture: The project has distinct functional areas that could be implemented as microservices: game management (including importing and exporting data), estimator management, estimate processing, and user authentication. Some user stories suggest a need for even more complex data processing, such as exporting transcripts of games as CSV files or further processing stories and estimates. This supports the use of a microservices architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Space-Based Architecture: While the project doesn't deal with massive datasets or highly concurrent operations that require distributed shared memory, some user stories suggest a need for even more distributed data storage. For example, storing results in a non-identifiable way to facilitate data analysis. This suggests that the space-based architecture could be partially suitable or well suited for the project's requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pipeline Architecture (Pipe-Filter Architecture): There are a few potential applications for a pipeline pattern, such as processing new game data or handling estimate exports. Some user stories suggest a need for even more complex data processing, which further supports the use of a pipeline architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Client-Server Architecture: This is fundamental to the project. The application is web-based, with users interacting through web browsers (clients) and a server handling requests, data, and business logic.\n",
